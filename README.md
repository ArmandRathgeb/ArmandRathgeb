*  Hi, I’m @ArmandRathgeb
* I’m interested in learning about C, C++, Matlab, Rust, and Python. There's just so much to learn
* I'm currently studying Biomedical Engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas
* Daily driving Arch Linux as my OS, with dwm as my window manager

Bit light on the commits and coding for now, but I hope to increase that with time.
