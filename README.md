*  Hi, I’m @ArmandRathgeb
* I’m interested in learning about C, C++, Matlab, Rust, and Python. There's just so much to learn
* I'm currently studying Biomedical Engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas
* Daily driving Arch Linux with Sway on Wayland.

Same thing here, I hope to diversify the languages displayed here!
